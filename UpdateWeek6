This program will create a randomizer like dice where a user needs to pick a number between 1-6 and a task will be given for thme to complete.
It is created to help motivate the user.
'''
# Prompt user to choose a number
print("Welcome Friend!")
print("Let's choose a number between 1 and 6:")

# Get input from user
user_input = input("Your choice: ")

# Try to convert input to an integer and validate it
if user_input.isdigit():
    number = int(user_input)
    if 1 <= number <= 6:
        print(f"Great! You chose the number {number}.")
        # TODO: Add more logic here (like a game or random challenge)
    else:
        print("Oops! That number is not between 1 and 6.")
else:
    print("Please enter a valid number.")

# TODO: Maybe repeat until valid input or add a game
